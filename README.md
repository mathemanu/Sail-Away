# Going-Green

We study a yacht dataset with the help of four different regression algorithms in order to evaluate performance of sailing yachts. The goal is to produce a regression model that can predict a performance factor (residuary resistance) for a sailing boat.

This work is inspired by the ever-pressing issue of climate change and the need to adopt environmentally friendly solutions in our lives.
